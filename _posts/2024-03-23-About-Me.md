### Hi
Hi Again.

This is a little introduction about me, just because I feel like I need 2 posts to begin with. üòÖ

I started programming around 15~16 years old. 
 
I lived in Brazil and there wasn't a good place to learn coding so I remember self teaching C. It was fun. But it was not until like 1 year ago, when I read KNK C Programming, that I understood C correctly.

Brief timeline until now:
- 2018-2021 : [game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsnWCGpVDLE&t=379s&ab_channel=Hnsh-%EB%AF%B8%EB%9E%98%EC%9D%98%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%EC%9E%90) dev with C# + Unity
- 2021 : [App dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUs8fQ1Xh5c&ab_channel=Hnsh-%EB%AF%B8%EB%9E%98%EC%9D%98%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%EC%9E%90) with Java & Android Studio
- 2022 : Problem Solving (DP, BFS/DFS, Data Structures, Sorting)
- 2023 - : Python & ML  

As of now, I have solved about 300 problems in Baekjoon Online Judge (Korean Codeforce) and 100 problems in Leetcode (not that much).

These days I am trying to learn ML/DL on my own time.

### Hobbies

I love music. I think I have pretty good hearing (something between relative pitch and perfect pitch). I like to **transcribe music** into sheets and tabs. When I like a music but the sheet isn't available I just [make one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S93OnVNIyNE&ab_channel=Hnsh-%EB%AF%B8%EB%9E%98%EC%9D%98%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%EC%9E%90).

I like playing **piano** as well. But I have don't know how to read sheets, so usually I just try to learn by seeing those youtube videos where the sheet is visualized with notes falling down.

I also play **guitar** (which is actually my main instrument). I have played for 5 years now. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfF-0mSsg0U&ab_channel=Hnsh-%EB%AF%B8%EB%9E%98%EC%9D%98%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%EC%9E%90) is me playing guitar :).

I like reading **fantasy novels**. Some of the best novels I have read are "ÏÑ∏ÏõîÏùò Îèå" and "ÌïòÏñÄ ÎäëÎåÄÎì§", which are korean novels.

I like **cooking** as well and my dream when I was young was to be a chef lol.

I like **blogging/writing and photography** as well.

Finally, I love **philosophy**. Especially, I like to contemplate on topics like what is human emotion, ego, and how can we model it? Maybe this is why I love ML/AI things from Computer Science.
