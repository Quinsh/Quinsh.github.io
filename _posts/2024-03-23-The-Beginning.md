# As I Begin This

Hi! I have been writing in different platforms.
But now I will totally move to Github Blog.  

Couple of things about how my life has been until now:  

I am in my 1st year of college (Grinnell College).  

I have been a little bit indecisive between pursuing a AI career and bank (but skewing towards AI).
Currently, I have secured an internship in BTG Pactual, which is an investemnt bank in Brazil, but I feel like I should have applied to research roles. I was drawn to fintech last semester, but I feel like my true passion or motivation lies is AI/ML.  

Especially, I want to become a scientist who investigates Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) and some deep learning / neuroscience. This is actually a little different from being a Data Scientist. I probably will need at least Masters.  

Cognition, emotion, and ego are all fields that remain mysterious and unexplored as of 2024. The fact that this is undiscovered and the possibility that we might be able to create ASI in the future excites me. I think this is my greatest passion.  

These days I am studying major ML algorithms, and then I will step into deep learning. I have done these before, but I am re-learning in more details. This semester I made a ML Club, in which I had 3rd/4th years to join and help me in teaching and practicing machine learning together to promote ML skills in our college. I am very excited for this as well!
