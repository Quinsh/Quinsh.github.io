# Preface
I had gotten into the IBM Externship (job shadowing program) offered by our school.

It was about 4 days during the Spring break. I visited California for the first time and had the change to visit tech company headquarters and Stanford University! (my host is in Stanford graduate school)

It was a very cool experience that brought a lot of meaning to me. It greatly influenced my thoughts and habits.

# Reflecition

## Career-wise
I think this trip really **motivated me to go to Graduate school**. I realized Masters would be needed if I want to do Data Science work. (and even more if I want to do Deep learning, Cognition, and Neuroscience things).

Although this was a work life shadowing, I enjoyed more the Grad School side than working. I have been there for short period so I do not understand completely, but my host's work seemed to be more like software developement, and I realized I like more some research roles than SWE. I am very thankful that this externship gave me these insights so that I could find my path. 

Furthermore, in Stanford, seeing a lot of people focused doing something of their passion, it made me rethink if I was too much focused on making money and not on my passion. It seems that the **effort made just to earn money cannot surpass the effort and success driven by passion**. Sam Altman once mentioned that even people who dive into something for money end up finding their mission and passion for why they should do the work, allowing them to endure longer based on that. Now, I think I understand what that means. Let's not worry too much about money.

Well. Living in California seemed really good. If only I can get into Stanford later haha. But I want to live in New York as well; I like a dynamic and rushed atmosphere like NY city.


## Life-wise

The first thing I've come to learn a lot about is **gratitude and humility**. I'm talking about genuine gratitude, not the kind of burdening gratitude one might adopt just because those around them emphasize its importance. Paradoxically, while Korea places a high value on gratitude and humility, it often lacks the environment that truly fosters these feelings. In Korea, humility can often be a sort of performative modesty, where it's considered more admirable and respectable to not show off one's abilities, so people adopt this humility out of social awareness. On the other hand, I learned the true humilty, which isn't about deceitfully hiding one's greatness; **it's about having pride and self-esteem in one's abilities while also respecting others**. For example, not comparing people as a way of showing respect, supporting others when they try something new without disparaging them, and having confidence in oneself, among others.

The korean (and asian) mindset of relentlessly pursuing the top, questioning if one can truly be grateful for their current situation if they believe they can do better, is highly toxic. No wonder why  Korea has the lowest happiness index, the highest suicide rates, and the worst birth rates (0.64 as of 2024). How can happiness prevail when everyone strives to be in the top 0.01% and is never satisfied with their situation? **Being grateful for the current situation, not looking sideways but forward**, appears to be the key to happiness among Americans. In Silicon Valley, I didn't see incredibly fancy cars. People earning six figures drive Hondas, Subarus, Kias, and Toyotas, though Teslas and Audis are also popular. This contrasts sharply with areas like Gangnam or Cheongdam in Korea, where nearly every car passing by is a Mercedes. It's different from Korean culture where if something is deemed good, everyone rushes to follow it.

Also, I felt that my host and also other Stanford students are organized and focused on what they do (at least more than I am). I felt the need to **block any external noises that distract me from my goal**.

Finally, **"be nice"**. As toxic mindsets do not last long.
