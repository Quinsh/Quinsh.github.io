I was just talking with a PhD. He said that AI is a field where only the best one (best individual / best company) survives, and so just relaying on programming is not good because, as you get older, you are replaced by younger and better programmers. I should set my goals clearly. If I want to do R&D/research, it's fine to just major in AI/DL. If I want to earn money and do startups with an MS/PhD, it would be good to focus on some field other than AI (like bioengineering) so that I can have unique insights.

Also, **vision** is the most important thing. Those who become really big don't learn something and then think about what to do then. They have their own vision and goals and then learn the tools necessary to establish that goal. I think this is really true. What do I want to do? Let's pause and set my goals clearly. I have always wanted to develop ASI. so I think I'll end up majoring in neuroscience at smoe point. Bioengineering seems interesting; well, my focus right now is on the Neural side.
